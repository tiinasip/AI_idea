# Recycle information fo

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?

Instructions

Edit the README
Click the pen symbol to start editing
Write about your project
Save the README by clicking ‘Commit changes’
NOTE: you can edit your project description freely but please make sure it contains the following:

A heading called Summary (created in markdown like this: ##Summary)
A short description text (about 250 characters) under Summary
The words “Building AI course project” - for example right under the Project title or at the end of the Summary
Some formatting, for example headings: Tags # and ## are used to create headings – you can keep the example headings to create structure on the README

Adding images
Create a clear picture of your project with images like charts, screenshots or photos. To add files, go to the start of your project repository.

upload files
After adding files, you need to commit the changes:

commit to repo
When you perform a commit, you are saving the current state of the project repository. This way you can go back in history, see the changes made to any of your project files, and reset the project to a previous state if needed. When collaborating with others, this is an essential feature.

To add images to your README, you need to:

Link to an image you’ve uploaded to your repository like this:

![image of a cat](/cat_image.jpg)
Or link to an online image:

![image of an online cat](https://tinyurl.com/elementsofaicat)
Remember to use only images you own the copyright to or which are published with a Creative Commons license. For example the online image in the example is called Sleeping Cat on Her Back by Umberto Salvagnin / CC BY 2.0

More formatting options
There are a lot of different ways to format the content in a README with markdown. Check out these manuals in GitHub for further ideas:

How about adding some code?
If you are familiar with coding, consider forking the repository of an interesting, open source AI project. This is a nice way to start experimenting, even if you’re not very experienced with coding. It’s a good practice to only fork repositories that have been licensed as open source. Technically you can fork any public repositories, but you can’t build your work on them without the license.

As soon as you add code to the mix, you’ll need to use some desktop tools as well. In practice, you’ll write and edit code on your computer using a code editor of your choice, then push the changes you make to your GitHub repository using some Git magic. If it’s all new to you, don’t worry – you’ll learn it by doing it. Here’s a good tutorial to get you started: Git Handbook
