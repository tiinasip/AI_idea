# Local government visible
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Is the local school being shut? Where will budget cuts hit? Which political party advocated for which policies in your neighborhood? Residents rarely have timely access to information about upcoming changes especially between elections. 

This application collects data from local government documents and generates summaries and predictions. 

## Background
Local government operations often remain hidden from public view, and residents typically only hear about them through occasional local media coverage. As a result, voters may not fully understand which responsibilities fall under municipal control and which do not.

This tool enables users to follow and better understand the workings of their municipal government. Users are able to ask questions from local government and, on the other hand, local government learns to make decisions clearer when they know they will be closely followed.

## How is it used?
The user visits a website and selects their municipality. Additional filters are available, such as environmental issues, financial situation, schools, daycare centers, and the compensation of elected officials. Upon requesting the current status, the user receives an overview of ongoing matters either related to their selected interests or a general municipal update.

Anyone interested is a potential user.

## Data sources and AI methods
Local government documents are public and already available online. The tool is trained to locate and retrieve these sources. It also gathers information on local political power structures and appointed officials.
The interface has two parts: first, the user selects their municipality and areas of interest. Then, they can interact with the data through a chat interface powered by AI, similar to ChatGPT.

## Challenges
Government documents are complex and may be misinterpreted by both the AI and the user. The solution must provide clear source references so users can verify the information.
Additionally, the system may highlight individual officials. If this occurs in the context of misunderstood data, it could lead to inappropriate contact with those individuals.

## What next?
If I decide to start the project, I would need technical and legal advice. 

My technical skills are currently not at the required level, but finding a technical partner is feasible. I would also need assistance with promoting the idea and of course I need funding.

Instructions

Edit the README
Click the pen symbol to start editing
Write about your project
Save the README by clicking ‘Commit changes’
NOTE: you can edit your project description freely but please make sure it contains the following:

A heading called Summary (created in markdown like this: ##Summary)
A short description text (about 250 characters) under Summary
The words “Building AI course project” - for example right under the Project title or at the end of the Summary
Some formatting, for example headings: Tags # and ## are used to create headings – you can keep the example headings to create structure on the README

Adding images
Create a clear picture of your project with images like charts, screenshots or photos. To add files, go to the start of your project repository.

upload files
After adding files, you need to commit the changes:

commit to repo
When you perform a commit, you are saving the current state of the project repository. This way you can go back in history, see the changes made to any of your project files, and reset the project to a previous state if needed. When collaborating with others, this is an essential feature.

To add images to your README, you need to:

Link to an image you’ve uploaded to your repository like this:

![image of a cat](/cat_image.jpg)
Or link to an online image:

![image of an online cat](https://tinyurl.com/elementsofaicat)
Remember to use only images you own the copyright to or which are published with a Creative Commons license. For example the online image in the example is called Sleeping Cat on Her Back by Umberto Salvagnin / CC BY 2.0

More formatting options
There are a lot of different ways to format the content in a README with markdown. Check out these manuals in GitHub for further ideas:

How about adding some code?
If you are familiar with coding, consider forking the repository of an interesting, open source AI project. This is a nice way to start experimenting, even if you’re not very experienced with coding. It’s a good practice to only fork repositories that have been licensed as open source. Technically you can fork any public repositories, but you can’t build your work on them without the license.

As soon as you add code to the mix, you’ll need to use some desktop tools as well. In practice, you’ll write and edit code on your computer using a code editor of your choice, then push the changes you make to your GitHub repository using some Git magic. If it’s all new to you, don’t worry – you’ll learn it by doing it. Here’s a good tutorial to get you started: Git Handbook
